## Project info
Intelligent Workflow Orchestrator Overview
Intelligent Workflow Orchestrator is likely a software tool or platform designed to automate workflows and business processes with a focus on fluid, efficient, and customizable automation flows. It may integrate with or be inspired by open-source workflow engines such as Flowable, which is a popular BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation), CMMN (Case Management Model and Notation), and DMN (Decision Model and Notation) engine.

## Key Features and Concepts
Workflow Automation: Automates repetitive tasks and orchestrates complex workflows, reducing manual intervention. This can include tasks like file management, transcoding, data processing, or business process automation.

**Flowable Integration** : Flowable is an open-source BPMN engine that allows modeling and execution of business processes, cases, and decisions. It supports creating applications (Flow-Apps) that bundle process definitions, forms, and dashboards into deployable units accessible via web interfaces.

**Flow-App Concept**: A Flow-App groups process definitions and dashboards into a single application with pages that provide task lists, charts, and other visual components. These apps appear as menu items in Flowable Work or Engage, enabling users to interact with workflows and monitor process metrics in real-time.

**Extensible and Low-Code:** Tools like Flowable and likely Fluent Flow Automator emphasize low-code or no-code approaches, enabling users to design workflows visually and automate processes without deep programming knowledge.

**Integration and Extensibility**: Such platforms often provide APIs and connectors to integrate with other systems, cloud services, and AI tools for enhanced automation capabilities.

**Use Cases:** Common use cases include media management automation (copying, moving, transcoding), business process orchestration, task automation, and cloud delivery pipelines.

**Technical Highlights** (Based on Flowable and Similar Platforms)
**Open Source Core**: Many automation platforms like Flowable offer open-source engines under Apache 2 License, allowing customization and community contributions.

**Docker Support**: Ready-to-run Docker images for REST API and UI components simplify deployment and testing.

**Dashboard and Reporting**: Dashboards provide real-time insights into process instances, task statuses, and performance metrics using charts and lists.

**Scalability and Cloud Deployment**: Such tools are designed to scale from embedded use cases to cloud-native deployments on Kubernetes or serverless environments.
